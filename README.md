# Word-Checker
â€¢	Description
The input to the program is a file that contains random words, and a word to search for in the input. And the output of the program is whether the word exists in the input file. 
The number of words in the input files vary from 1,000 to 100,000,000 words. I am going to use Hash Table and Binary Search Tree data structure for this project.
